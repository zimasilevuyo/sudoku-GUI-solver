The window will open displaying a sudoku board.

Run the mouse cursor over the square that you want to enter a number into.
Then press one of the numbers on your keyboard to enter.
If it is a valid entry, it will work. If not, it is conflicting with the generated squares.

To make a square blank, use the number 0.
